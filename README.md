<h1> Chat Application </h1>
Full-stack chat application using the MEVN stack. 
Using this in order to improve my CSS skills (grid and responsiveness specifically), along with working with Node.Js and MongoDB. 

<h2> Design </h2>
Currently I've created a Figma prototype for the desktop and mobile versions, although not all pages are done yet.
